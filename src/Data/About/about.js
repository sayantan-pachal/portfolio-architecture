        "I’m a B.Tech CSE first-year student with a strong curiosity about technology and how it shapes the future. My approach to learning is simple — take the time to truly understand concepts, gain proper knowledge, and apply it to real-world problem-solving. I enjoy creative thinking, exploring new technologies, and finding innovative ways to approach challenges.",
        "Currently, I’m focused on development and AI/ML, sharpening my skills through both academic learning and certifications. I’ve earned multiple certifications from freeCodeCamp, including Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Front End Development Libraries, Scientific Computing with Python, and Foundational C# with Microsoft. I also completed projects like a Random Question Generator during an LPU Python course, which strengthened my programming foundations.",
        "In the short term, my goal is to master my skills and gain internship experience to apply my knowledge in real-world settings. Looking ahead, I aspire to grow into a software engineer, explore the field of AI research, and perhaps one day build my own venture.",
        "Outside of coding, I love playing cricket and chess, and I’m always eager to explore new ideas, experiences, and technologies that inspire growth.",
